Added support for device model. Compatibility with non-DM code is kept
for easier synchronization with the code on the vendor branch where the
conversion to DM is not done for all boards.

Changes in v3:
Removed non-DM compatibility, as requested.

Changes in v4:
Corrected typo: s/_debUG_uart_init/_debug_uart_init/
